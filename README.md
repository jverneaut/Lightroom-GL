# [WIP] Lightroom GL

## Motivation

Who wants to pay \$10 per month for a service when you can spend countless sleepless nights building your own version?

Yeah... me neither.

But I did it anyway.

This projects aims to replicate Lightroom's develop tab and to make it available to all aspiring photographers on the web.

## Technology

This project is entirely built using **Svelte** and native **WebGL**. It makes use of GLSL shaders to process the image.

## Contributing

This project is still pretty much in its infancy and as such allowing contributions isn't something I'm considering right now.

However, if you encounter a bug feel free to file an issue or submit a PR, I'll make sure to review them.
